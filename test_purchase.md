# Testing the Fixed Purchase Functionality

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Redux Imports**
- Added `updateBillingHistory` and `updatePaymentMethod` imports
- Added `setBoughtPremium` import from PremiumBookSlice

### 2. **Redux State Management**
- Now properly updates current plan in Redux after successful payment
- Updates payment method information in Redux
- Adds purchase to billing history (appends to existing history)
- Sets premium status correctly for non-free plans

### 3. **Billing History**
- Fixed billing history update to append new purchases to existing history instead of replacing it
- Ensures purchase appears immediately in the billing section

### 4. **Payment Flow**
1. User selects plan on premium page → navigates to `/checkout`
2. User fills out payment form and clicks "Complete Purchase"
3. Data is saved to Supabase `subscriptions` table
4. Redux state is updated with:
   - Current plan information
   - Payment method details
   - New billing history entry
   - Premium purchase status
5. User is redirected to `/success` page

## Test Steps

1. **Go to Premium Page**: Navigate to `/premium`
2. **Select a Plan**: Click on Premium or Ultimate plan
3. **Fill Checkout Form**: Complete all required fields
4. **Complete Purchase**: Click "Complete Purchase"
5. **Verify Success**: Should redirect to success page
6. **Check Billing**: Go to Settings → Billing to verify:
   - Current plan shows the purchased plan
   - Payment method is updated
   - Billing history shows the purchase
   - Premium features are enabled

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Purchase data saves to Supabase
- ✅ Redux state updates immediately  
- ✅ Billing page reflects new subscription
- ✅ Premium features become available
- ✅ Success page shows purchase details

## Files Modified

1. `/src/Pages/CheckOut/Checkout.tsx`
   - Added missing Redux imports
   - Fixed Redux state updates after successful payment
   - Fixed billing history append logic
